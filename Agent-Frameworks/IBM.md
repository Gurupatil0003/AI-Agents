## 🚀 Sample AI Agent Workflow

1. User: "I lost my credit card."
2. Watson: Detects intent → *Report Lost Card*
3. Watson: Asks follow-up → "Can I have your last 4 digits?"
4. Watson: Extracts entity → *Account Number*
5. Watson: Calls bank API to block card
6. Watson: Responds → "Your card ending with 1234 is now blocked."
