# What is AI Agent
An AI Agent is an entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment using actuators to achieve specific goals. It operates autonomously, making decisions based on its perceptions, internal state, and knowledge, often using artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning, reasoning, or planning.

In simpler terms:
An AI agent senses, thinks, and acts â€” often in an intelligent, goal-directed way.


## Characteristics of AI Agents

### 1. Autonomy
- Operates without human intervention.
- Makes decisions independently based on inputs and prior learning.

### 2. Perception
- Uses sensors (physical or virtual) to observe the environment.
- Continuously gathers and processes information for decision-making.

### 3. Action
- Interacts with and changes the environment using actuators or interfaces.

### 4. Goal-Oriented Behavior
- Acts with specific objectives or goals in mind.
- Evaluates and selects actions that best help achieve those goals.

### 5. Adaptability and Learning
- Learns from past experiences or data.
- Improves performance over time (if it is a learning agent).

### 6. Reactivity and Proactiveness
- Reacts to changes in the environment.
- Can proactively take initiative to pursue long-term objectives.

### 7. Social Ability *(in some cases)*
- Communicates with other agents or humans using defined protocols.
- Common in multi-agent systems and collaborative tasks.

### 8. Persistence and Continuity
- Exists over time with a consistent internal state.
- Can store and retrieve historical data for long-term or complex tasks.
