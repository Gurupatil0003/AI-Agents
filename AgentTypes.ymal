## 🧩 Types of AI Agents

AI agents can be categorized based on how they perceive, process, and act on information:

---

### ⚡ 1. Reactive Agents
- **Behavior:**
  - Respond directly to stimuli from the environment.
  - No internal memory or world model.
- **Pros:**
  - Fast and simple.
  - Suitable for predictable environments.
- **Real-Life Examples:**
  - 🕹️ **Automatic Room Lights** – Turn on/off when motion is detected.
  - 🧹 **Robot Vacuum (Basic)** – Changes direction when hitting a wall.
  - 🤖 **Line-following robots** – Follow a path without memory of previous turns.

---

### 🧠 2. Cognitive Agents
- **Behavior:**
  - Use internal models and reasoning to make decisions.
  - Capable of planning, understanding goals, and learning.
- **Features:**
  - Often follow architectures like **BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention)**.
  - Can learn from experience (e.g., using Reinforcement Learning).
- **Real-Life Examples:**
  - 🗺️ **Google Maps** – Plans routes using live traffic and historical data.
  - 🎮 **AlphaGo** – Thinks multiple moves ahead using deep reasoning.
  - 🗣️ **Virtual Assistants (Siri, Alexa)** – Understand goals and make smart decisions.

---

### 🔀 3. Hybrid Agents
- **Behavior:**
  - Combine reactive and cognitive elements.
  - Can act quickly while also engaging in deep reasoning when needed.
- **Architecture:**
  - Layered design: Reactive layer handles immediate responses; cognitive layer manages planning.
- **Real-Life Examples:**
  - 🚗 **Self-Driving Cars (e.g., Tesla)** – React instantly to obstacles while planning navigation routes.
  - 🚁 **Smart Drones** – Avoid real-time obstacles and plan flight paths.
  - 🤖 **Advanced Home Robots** – Navigate homes and help users intelligently.

# 🧠 Types of AI Agents: Cognitive, Reactive, and Hybrid

Understanding different types of AI agents with real-life, relatable examples.

---

## 1. Cognitive Agent
**Definition**:  
A cognitive agent **thinks before acting**. It uses memory, reasoning, and planning to make decisions.

**🧩 Real-life Example**: **Google Maps**  
- Plans the best route using live traffic and historical data.
- Makes decisions based on logic and past experiences.
- It behaves like a "thinking" assistant.

---

## 2. Reactive Agent
**Definition**:  
A reactive agent **does not have memory or planning ability**. It simply **reacts** to the current environment.

**⚡ Real-life Example**: **Automatic Room Lights with Motion Sensors**  
- Turns on/off based on motion detection.
- No learning or memory—only responds to current input.
- Acts instantly, like a reflex.

---

## 3. Hybrid Agent
**Definition**:  
A hybrid agent combines both **cognitive (thinking)** and **reactive (instant acting)** abilities.

**⚖️ Real-life Example**: **Self-Driving Cars (like Tesla)**  
- **Reactive**: Instantly stops if someone crosses the road.
- **Cognitive**: Plans the optimal route, follows traffic rules, and adapts over time.
- Best of both worlds — fast reactions and smart planning.

## 🔁 Quick Comparison Table

| Type       | Real-Life Example         | Key Traits                            |
|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Cognitive  | Google Maps               | Thinks, plans, uses past data          |
| Reactive   | Motion sensor lights      | Instantly reacts, no memory or planning|
| Hybrid     | Self-driving car (Tesla)  | Reacts instantly + plans smartly       |
