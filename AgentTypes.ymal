## ðŸ§© Types of AI Agents

AI agents can be categorized based on how they perceive, process, and act on information:

### âš¡ 1. Reactive Agents
- **Behavior:**
  - Respond directly to stimuli from the environment.
  - No internal memory or world model.
- **Pros:**
  - Fast and simple.
  - Suitable for predictable environments.
- **Examples:**
  - Simple rule-based bots.
  - Line-following robots.

### ðŸ§  2. Cognitive Agents
- **Behavior:**
  - Use internal models and reasoning to make decisions.
  - Capable of planning, understanding goals, and learning.
- **Features:**
  - Often follow architectures like **BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention)**.
  - Can learn from experience (e.g., using Reinforcement Learning).
- **Examples:**
  - Virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa).
  - Game-playing agents (e.g., AlphaGo).

### ðŸ”€ 3. Hybrid Agents
- **Behavior:**
  - Combine reactive and cognitive elements.
  - Can act quickly while also engaging in deep reasoning when needed.
- **Architecture:**
  - Layered design: Reactive layer handles immediate responses; cognitive layer manages planning.
- **Examples:**
  - Self-driving cars.
  - Smart drones with real-time obstacle avoidance + route planning.
